## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

1. _p -> q_
2. _p -> r_
3. _(p AND p) -> (q AND r)_ by 1 and 2
4. _(p AND p) = p_ 
5. _p -> (q AND r)_ by 3 and 4


### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

1. _p -> (q OR r)_
2. _p -> (q OR NOT r)_
3. let q be _false_
4. _p -> r_ by 1 and 3
5. _p -> NOT r_ by 2 and 3
6. 4 and 5 are contradictory if _p_, therefore assumption at 3 is untrue if _p_, therefore _p -> q_


## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

_p_ | _q_ | _r_ | _p -> q_ | _p -> r_ | _(p->q) AND (p->r)_ | _p -> (q AND r)_
----|-----|-----|----------|----------|---------------------|-----------------
 T  |  T  |  T  |    T     |    T     |          T          |        T
 T  |  T  |  F  |    T     |    F     |          F          |        F
 T  |  F  |  T  |    F     |    T     |          F          |        F
 T  |  F  |  F  |    F     |    F     |          F          |        F
 F  |  T  |  T  |    T     |    T     |          T          |        T
 F  |  T  |  F  |    T     |    T     |          T          |        T
 F  |  F  |  T  |    T     |    T     |          T          |        T
 F  |  F  |  F  |    T     |    T     |          T          |        T


## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

*answer:* Satisfiable (by _p_,_q_, and _r true_), and indeed a tautology (no possible case where _(p AND q AND r)_ and _NOT (p OR Q)_)

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

*answer:* Tautology.

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

*answer:* Satisfiable (by _p_ and _q true_), not a tautology (if _p_ false, _(p -> q)_ still _true_, which implies _p_, which is a contradiction)

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 
```
(p OR q OR r)
AND
((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r))
AND
(p OR (NOT q))
AND
(q OR (NOT r))
OR
(r OR (not p))_ 
```

*answer:* 
I am going to solve two ways:

1) assuming a typo in the second to last `OR` which I instead substitute an `AND`:

In this case, the expression is satisfiable by any two of _p_, _q_, and _r_ beeing _true_, and the third _false_.

2) assuming no typo, and with left-evaluation (i.e. `((...) AND (...) AND (...) AND (...)) OR (...)`)

_p_ | _q_ | _r_ | _T_
----|-----|-----|-----
 T  |  T  |  T  |  T
 T  |  T  |  F  |  T
 T  |  F  |  T  |  T
 T  |  F  |  F  |  T
 F  |  T  |  T  |  T
 F  |  T  |  F  |  F
 F  |  F  |  T  |  T
 F  |  F  |  F  |  T

 Therefore, _T_ is satisfiable but not a tautology.

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_

*answer:* satisfiable, not a tautology.

_(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p_ XNOR _r))_ however, *is* a tautology I believe

## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

*answer:*

_NOT (a AND b) <=> (NOT a) OR (NOT b)_, therefore:
_p OR (q AND ((NOT r) OR (NOT s -> t)))_

_a OR (b AND c) <=> (a OR b) AND (a OR c)_, therefore:
_(p OR q) AND (p OR ((NOT r) OR (NOT s -> t)))_

_(p OR q) AND (p OR (NOT r) OR (NOT s -> t))_


## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

Because I missed class, I'm not sure exactly what these two methods are, but I'll give it a go anyway.

The above formula is satisfied by _p true_, and unsatisfied by _p_ and _q false_.
